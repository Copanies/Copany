3.1 Contribution Tracking Mechanism
• All contributions (code, design, documentation, etc.) must be submitted via public Issues or Pull Requests;
• Each contribution shall be assigned Contribution Points (CPs) to reflect its value;
• All CP records must be transparent and publicly accessible, preferably maintained via the Copany platform or public repositories.

3.2 Revenue Sharing Obligations

If the Project or any of its Derivatives generates Net Revenue, the party controlling the revenue must:
• Distribute the revenue within 15 days of receipt according to the Contribution Point proportions at the time the revenue was earned;
• Publish a revenue report and distribution record within 30 days of receipt;
• Notify major contributors prior to any commercialization or licensing of the Project.

Failure to fulfill these obligations shall be considered a breach of this license.

3.3 Breach and Enforcement

Contributors holding valid CPs have the right to request fair revenue distribution and to pursue legal remedies in case of breach.

4. Management of Derivative Works

All Derivative Works must remain licensed under COSL or a license with equivalent obligations that preserve attribution, contribution tracking, and revenue sharing.

If a Derivative is jointly licensed with other terms, those terms must not override or nullify the protections granted to contributors under this license.
