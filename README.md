## Introduction

Copany is a collaboration platform that transparently records contributions of teams and communities, quantifies efforts, and fairly distributes proceeds based on contribution points.

It is not only a software tool but also a new collaboration philosophy — aiming to redefine contribution and revenue distribution in open-source projects, and to explore a more open, fair, and creativity-driven way to organize teams and companies.

## Mission, Vision, and Values

- Mission: Make collaboration fairer and more transparent, and explore new organizational models beyond traditional corporations
- Vision: Help people rediscover the joy of free creation
- Values: Freedom of choice, equality in communication, fair rewards

## Features

- Open collaboration: All tasks are managed via Issues, and everyone can participate
- Contribution points: Each task has points assigned by difficulty to record individual contributions
- Revenue sharing: Any revenue generated by the project is distributed to contributors according to contribution points
- Explicit license: Based on the [Copany Open Source License (COSL)](https://github.com/Copanies/Copany/blob/main/LICENSE)
- Community-driven: All processes are open and transparent; public oversight is welcome

## How to Contribute

1. Open the [Issues](https://copany.app/copany/5?tab=Cooperate&subtab=Issue) page and create a new Issue or find a suitable one
2. Submit an Issue assignment request and communicate with the project maintainers
3. Set up your local development environment: see the [Local Development Setup Guide](https://github.com/Copanies/Copany/blob/main/local-development-setup.md)
4. Complete the Issue and set its status to In review
5. After the Issue passes review, you will receive the corresponding Contribution Points (CP)
6. All contributions are recorded on the [Contributions](https://copany.app/copany/5?tab=Contribution&subtab=Issue) page

## Contribution Points

CP points = Risk level × Complexity base CP value + Bonus

- Complexity reflects the consensus on the difficulty of completing the task. Levels: C, B, A, S. Each level has a different base CP value.
- Risk level varies with the project stage. Earlier stages generally involve higher risk.
- Bonus rewards are used to encourage high-quality contributions.

> The basic logic for judging complexity is the time and effort a person needs to complete the task. However, since experience varies, the perceived effort varies as well, which may cause disagreements on complexity. Therefore, we introduce consensus to maintain relative fairness and efficiency in judgment.

The following estimated time per complexity level uses the project lead (@easybreezy) as an example:

| Level | Complexity                      | Estimated Time | Base CP |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| C     | Small fixes / docs updates      | 1-2h           | 5       |
| B     | Regular feature development     | 4-6h           | 20      |
| A     | Core module or design           | 12-18h         | 60      |
| S     | Architecture / core development | 32-40h         | 200     |

> The consensus mechanism is not finalized yet. Contributions are welcome.

## Revenue Distribution

When the project receives economic returns, including but not limited to:

- Sponsorships, crowdfunding
- Commercial licensing
- Paid services or products
- Investment or acquisition

Revenue is distributed according to the current contribution points table:

Individual revenue = (Personal CP) / (Total CP) × Net revenue

All distribution records will be published via Copany or automatically distributed on the Copany platform.
