# Copany123123

> At Copany, we're building a world where people don't need to join a company to build something great together. Just show up, contribute, and be part of the future.

## 🚀 Project Introduction

This project is an open-source collaboration project where anyone can participate in contributions and share project revenue based on their contribution ratio.

We believe that open source is not just about code sharing, but should be **value sharing**. Through the Copany protocol (COSL), we have established a transparent, fair, and sustainable contribution incentive mechanism.
